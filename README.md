# TsmManager
This app demonstrates how TransModeler simulation can be managed from an external (out-of-process) Windows Forms app. 

It uses the CaliperForm.dll (included under the ./TsmManager/lib folder) for communication with TransModeler.

This project requires TransModeler full or SE version installed on the computer.
